I have one temp table. In certain task I will add 20 lakh uetrs and once that operation completes I will erase that table. In second time if again adding 1 lakh record for some other operation. I am trying to get uetrs suddenly it is stopped providing that uetrs even table having values. After running truncate table alone I can perform second operation. What is the problem related to that table vacuum analysis on only. Kindly help to solve this problem


Let me help analyze this PostgreSQL issue you're experiencing. Let me understand the scenario correctly:

You're using a temporary table
First operation: You insert 2 million records (20 lakh UETRs)
You erase the data
Second operation: You try to insert 100,000 records (1 lakh UETRs)
The table stops working properly until you use TRUNCATE
This behavior suggests a few potential issues:

Are you using DELETE or TRUNCATE to erase the data after the first operation? If using DELETE, it might be causing:
Table bloat
Autovacuum not keeping up
Statistics becoming stale
Here's what I recommend trying:

sql

Copy
-- After your first operation completes and you want to clear the table
TRUNCATE TABLE your_temp_table;
-- Then run
ANALYZE your_temp_table;
If you still need to use DELETE instead of TRUNCATE, try this approach:

sql

Copy
-- After bulk DELETE
VACUUM ANALYZE your_temp_table;
A few questions to help diagnose further:

How are you erasing the data currently (DELETE or TRUNCATE)?
Is this a regular temporary table (created with CREATE TEMP TABLE) or a permanent table?
Also, consider monitoring table statistics with:

sql

Copy
SELECT relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup, last_autovacuum 
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE relname = 'your_temp_table';
This will help understand if there's an issue with dead tuples accumulating in your table.

Copy
Retry

Could you please explain below points in detail:
Table bloat
Autovacuum not keeping up
Statistics becoming stale


Let me explain each of these PostgreSQL concepts in detail:

Table Bloat:
When you DELETE records, PostgreSQL doesn't immediately reclaim the physical space
The deleted rows are marked as "dead tuples" but still occupy space on disk
Over time, this leads to "bloat" - where your table takes up more space than it needs
Example:
sql

Copy
-- Table with 1 million rows taking 100MB
DELETE FROM table WHERE id < 500000;
-- Table still uses ~100MB despite having only 500,000 rows
Impact: Slower queries, more I/O, wasted disk space
Solution: Use TRUNCATE for complete cleanup or regular VACUUM for partial cleanup
Autovacuum Not Keeping Up:
Autovacuum is PostgreSQL's automatic cleanup process
It triggers based on certain thresholds:
sql

Copy
-- Check autovacuum settings
SELECT name, setting 
FROM pg_settings 
WHERE name LIKE 'autovacuum%';
Common scenarios where it falls behind:
Too many dead tuples accumulating too quickly
Heavy write workload
Resource constraints (CPU/IO)
Signs of autovacuum struggling:
sql

Copy
-- Check for tables with high dead tuple counts
SELECT relname, n_dead_tup, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE n_dead_tup > 10000;
Impact: Performance degradation, increased table bloat
Solutions:
Adjust autovacuum parameters
sql

Copy
ALTER TABLE your_table SET (
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.1,
  autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05
);
Manual VACUUM during maintenance windows
Stale Statistics:
PostgreSQL's query planner relies on table statistics to create efficient execution plans
Statistics include:
Number of rows
Data distribution
Common values
They become stale when:
Large number of changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
Significant changes in data distribution
Check current statistics:
sql

Copy
SELECT schemaname, tablename, last_analyze, last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE tablename = 'your_table';
Impact:
Poor query plans
Unexpected performance issues
Wrong join strategies
Solutions:
Regular ANALYZE
sql

Copy
-- After bulk operations
ANALYZE your_table;

-- Get detailed statistics
SELECT * FROM pg_stats 
WHERE tablename = 'your_table';
For your specific case with temporary tables, here's a recommended approach:

sql

Copy
-- After bulk operations
TRUNCATE TABLE temp_table;  -- Clean removal of all data
ANALYZE temp_table;         -- Update statistics

-- Or if using DELETE
DELETE FROM temp_table WHERE condition;
VACUUM ANALYZE temp_table;  -- Clean up space and update statistics

-- Monitor table health
SELECT relname, 
       n_live_tup,
       n_dead_tup,
       last_vacuum,
       last_analyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE relname = 'temp_table';
These concepts are interconnected - table bloat leads to autovacuum struggling, which in turn can lead to stale statistics. Managing them properly is key to maintaining good database performance.
